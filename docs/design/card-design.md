## Brainstorming / Design Document for Card Types & Behaviors
### Base Game
1. Exploding Kitten
    - Check if player has defuse card
    - if not, player loses and discards hand
    - if yes, discard defuse and reinsert exploding kitten into the deck at place of choosing

2. Defuse
    - Has no behavior until Exploding Kitten is drawn
    - Discard upon use


3. Skip
    - End Player turn without drawing a card
    - Discard upon use
4. Attack
    - End Player turn without drawing a card
    - Force next player to play 2 turns
        - Stackable (think +2 card in Uno)
    - Discard upon use

5. Shuffle
    - Shuffle the Deck
    - Discard upon use
6. See the Future
    - Draw and view the next 3 cards
    - Return the 3 cards to the deck in the same order
    - Discard upon use

7. ~~Nope~~
   - ~~Cancel any card played by the active player~~

8. Basic Card
    - No behavior unless two of the same basic card are present
    - Playing a pair allows you to randomly choose a card from any other player
    - Discard the pair of cards upon use
9. Favor
    - Choose a player to give you one of their cards (of their choosing)
    - Discard upon use

    - Return the 3 cards to the deck in the order of your choosing
    - Discard upon use
2. Imploding Kitten
    - When drawn, check if this card is face up or face down
    - If face down, flip this card face up and reinsert into deck at place of your choosing
    - If face up, player immediately loses and discards hand
    - Discard after being drawn
3. Godcat
    - Can be played as any other card
        - Exceptions include Nope, Exploding Kitten, and Imploding Kitten
    - Discard upon use
4. Draw from Bottom
    - Draw a card from the bottom of the deck.
    - End Player turn
